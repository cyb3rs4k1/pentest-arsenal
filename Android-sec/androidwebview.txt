Android Webview:
----------------
Android WebView is a system component powered by Chrome that allows Android apps to display web content.
There are many apps out there that are simply wrappers around web pages, or web content stored in the app. 

Android Webview debugging:
--------------------------
In Android WebViews have a debugging feature, that allows you to use the ADB remote debugging extension for chrome to debug the contents of the WebView. 
2 ways to enable WebView
1. Smali modification
2. Frida 

Let's start with smali modification

Identify the application path and extract the apk from device.
$ adb shell pm list packages
$ adb shell pm path com.example.app
$ adb pull /data/app/com.example.app/base.apk 

Decompile apk using apktool
$ apktool d base.apk 

Figure out where to put the magic lines of code. Identify activity that will always run when the app starts.

Add Magic smali code:
const/4 v2, 0x1
invoke-static {v2}, Landroid/webkit/WebView;->setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(Z)V 

First line sets a variable to true
Second line passes that variable to the static method "setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled" in the WebView class. 

Recompile the application
$ apktool b ./base 
Sign and install the application 

Now Open chrome://inspect/devices and voila we can see the package name with inspect option. 
Click on inspect and you can see all the resources loaded including js.
