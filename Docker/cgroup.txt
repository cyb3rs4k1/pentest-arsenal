Cgroups

Cgroups or Control Groups are a Linux kernel feature to monitor and limit the resource usage of a process or a group of processes.

To test the functionality of cgroup restrictions, we will use eatmemory, a memory eating utility.

Github: https://github.com/julman99/eatmemory

Step 1: Check the content of the home directory of the root user.

Command: ls /root

Step 2: Switch to the eatmemory directory and list the contents.

Commands:

cd eatmemory
ls -l

Step 3: Run make utility to build the binary and check if the binary is created.

Commands:

make
ls -l

Step 4: Execute the binary and check the help menu.

Command: ./eatmemory -h

Step 5: Run the binary to consume 2 GB of memory.

Command: ./eatmemory 2G

One can observe that the memory was consumed and eatmemory is still running (before we terminated it with Ctrl+C).

Step 6: Create a memory cgroup named “test”.

Command: cgcreate -g memory:test

Step 7: Set memory limit of 4 MB to this cgroup.

Command: cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=4194304 test

Step 8 : Execute eatmemory to consume 2 GB memory but this time, confine it with “test” cgroup.

Command: cgexec -g memory:test ./eatmemory 2G

One can observe that eatmemory program got killed. This is because it tried to eat more memory (i.e. 2 GB) than allowed by the “test” cgroup (i.e. 4 MB).

Step 9: Try with 4 MB (equals to allowed cgroup memory limit).

Command: cgexec -g memory:test ./eatmemory 4M

The program still got killed. Most probably because it tried to eat 4 MB and the program itself must be consuming some memory to run, hence taking total memory consumption by this process beyond 4 MB.

Step 10: Try with 3 MB.

Command: cgexec -g memory:test ./eatmemory 3M

This time the process was not killed because it stayed in the limit of 4 MB.

NameSpaces:

Namespaces are features of Linux kernel to divide system resources into different logical partitions.
There are different namespaces supported by the kernel.

We will check on the most two prominent namespaces :
1. Process ID (PID) Namespace
2. Network Namespace
