*  Abbreviations : 
     STA = STAtion (Wireless Client)
     BSS = Basic Service Set ( set of nodes communicating with each other )
  	    - Infrastructure BSS (AP and clients)
  	    - Independednt BSS ( Ad-hoc clients)
     ESS = Extended Service Set ( set of connected BSSs) all of them connected to a distribution system
     BSSID = Basic Service Set Identifier
	      - Infrastructure BSS ( MAC address of AP)
      	- IBSS ( Randomly chosen MAC address )
     DS = Distribution System ( Connects APS in an ESS )

* Wireshark packet capture (Details) :
   * Frame - book keeping
   * Radiotap header :
           - channel type 
		         - channel frequency
		         - flags
		         - SSI Signal (can be used to triangulate the position of a hacker)
   * IEE 802.11	- Information about the packet

 * Frame control field - 2 bytes (16 bits)
 
 The following inside are categories of frame control field :
 ++-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++
 
* protocol - 2 bits) default value 0 - May change when a major revision happens incomapatible with the previous version
                 example : 0x0080 (normal)
* Type and subtype - 2 and 4 bits
       1 - type :  management, control and data frames
       2 - sub-types in each
       example : ox80 and 8 in the frame control field

* To and FROM DS - 1 and 1 bit :
  * To DS    From DS 	  Interpretation
     0	         0	      STA to STA in same IBSS(Ad-hoc) Management and control frames
     0	         1	      Exiting the distribution system (DS)
     1	         0	      Entering the DS
     1	         1	      Used in Wireless Distribution systems(wds)

 * more frag - 1 bit
   * indicates if more fragmes of the current frame are to follow
   * only application to data and management frames(only authentication packets)

* Retry field (1 byte)
Wifi is a very lossy medium. so any packet like telephone with same ap can also be used. so retry will check for the authenticity only to management andadata nodes.
	* indicates is current frame is a retransmission
	* applicable to management and data frames only

* Power management (1 byte)
	* Indicates if the sta is in power save mode or active mode.
	* Indicates which mode the packet is transfered.

* More data (1 byte)
	* Data is queued up on the ap. ( from power management)

* Protected frame:
	* Indicates that the frame body is encrypted
	* Data frames
	* Management frames of type auth
	* 0 indicates no encryption

* Order(1 byte)
	* Indicates that all received frames must be processed in order

 ++-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++


* Duration/ID : (Value set here is actually a counter)
	* The time used to wait before attempting the network( for next ms )
	* Used to set the network allocation vector (NAV)
	* NAV is the minimum amount of time a STA needs to wait before attempting transmission
	* Also used in CFP and PS-Poll frames.

* Address 1 , 2 ,3 and 4 : 
	* Value and presence depends on type/subtype
	* Destination address
	* Source address
	* BSSID

* Sequence control - (s.no)
	* sequence number of the packet
	* Fragment number of the packet

* Frame body
	* Contains the data payload
		* management frame details
		* Actual data

* FCS :
	* CRC check over the MAC header and frame body
	* Easy to beat
