WPA:
Intermediate solution by wifi alliance
Uses TKIP
	Based on WEP
Hardware changes not required
Firmware update is required.

WPA 2:
Long term solution 802.11i
Uses CCMP
	Based on AES
Hardware changes required.

Both WPA and WPA2 have personal and enterprise edition

Personal is PSK
Enterprise is 802.1x + Radius

How does the client know ?
Beacon frames
Probe response packets from the AP
Can be used to create a WPA/WPA2 honeypot as well.

Checking for WPA :
airodump-ng wlan0mon --channel 1

We have to analyze if the probe request has anything related to security encryptions.

Checking for WPA 2 :
Do the same above procedure.

But look for EAPOL (Key message 1,2,3,4)
